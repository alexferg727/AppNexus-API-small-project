# AppNexus-API-small-project
This is a repo to upload my code for an API app I am creating for personal use. This will use BeautifulSoup library, along with web scraping libraries and the Kivy python library to design and build my app designed to funnel all of my work from various different websites such as Canvas, Turnitin.com, google classroom and muic-elearning into one app on my phone for me to see and never lose track of deadlines.
Furthermore I indent to mess around with the app design to provide more information such as grades, predicted grades and anything that could further make my college life easier
